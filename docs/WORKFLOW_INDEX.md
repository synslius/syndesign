# Workflow Index

This is the routing table for agents using DASH Design Infra. Start here when the task is not “inspect the repo”, but “make a visual artifact that survives output.”

Each workflow has five required parts:

1. entry file;
2. package layer;
3. command path;
4. QA gate;
5. public boundary.

If a workflow cannot name those five things, it is not ready to ship.

Additive to existing audit; no runtime inflation. Exit 0 for informational audit, exit 1 if any surface lacks a CSS token layer. Revealed: 0 shared tokens, 14 diverged, 1 no-token-layer surface. Wired into regression orchestrator after cache-integrity. First diagnostic slice for NorthStar aesthetic coherence.

"ui-serif" bare token identifier used by 7 warm-paper surfaces (falls through to Georgia/Cambria). 4 surfaces use Georgia directly without ui-serif wrapper. ui-serif/Georgia-direct split is naming inconsistency, not addressable drift. Serif/sans split is family signature. No surface edits needed. Fixed canvas fits. | Public-safe diagnostic artifact; no surface edits |

## Agent Routing Rules

### If the user asks for a static document

Use the document path:

```bash
bun tokens:build
bun metrics:build
bun measure:check -- examples/one-pager.html
bun print:render -- examples/one-pager.html /tmp/dash-one-pager.pdf --canvas=1684x1191
```

Then adapt the HTML, not the verification path.

### If the user asks for p5.js / motion / poster work

Use `@dash/p5-motion` first. Do not start from raw private sketches. Pick a grammar:

- Electric Archive for memory, retrieval, signal, handoff, blue-field archive stories.
- Memory Weather Report for risk, benchmark pressure, evidence density, trend/forecast stories.
- Flow Field for organic DASH-branded visual texture.
- Kinetic Type for editorial title cards and typography as motion material.
- Data Weather for live/synthetic data mapped into visual parameters.
- Layer Composer when multiple presets need blend modes, z-ordering, and phase offsets.

A good motion workflow names:

- canvas size;
- layer model;
- deterministic seed or timeline phase;
- frame QA method;
- public preview boundary.

For v2 preset work, also run:

```bash
bun p5:motion-check
```

### If the user asks for video

Use workflow discipline before adding more visuals:

1. render in chunks;
2. make a contact sheet;
3. inspect density, flicker, compression risk;
4. compress to target delivery surface;
5. keep source media out of git.

### If the user asks to adapt an external skill or prompt workflow

Use the skill-ratchet path:

```bash
bun measure:check -- examples/darwin-ratchet-board.html
bun print:render -- examples/darwin-ratchet-board.html /tmp/dash-darwin-ratchet-board.pdf --canvas=1684x1191
bun security:scan
```

Do not install unknown skills blindly. Vet the source, extract the reusable loop, create synthetic public artifacts, then keep only score-backed improvements.

### If the user asks for creator-facing visual work

Use the creator capsule path before picking a renderer:

```bash
bun creator:capsule-check
bun measure:check -- examples/creator-frontier-capsule.html
bun print:render -- examples/creator-frontier-capsule.html /tmp/dash-creator-frontier-capsule.pdf --canvas=1684x1191
```

The useful unit is `idea -> capsule -> artifact -> proof -> remix trail`. If the target surface is a poster, use `bun creator:poster-check` and `examples/creator-poster-surface.html` before inventing a new renderer. If the target path is an image/video model, use `bun creator:prompt-dna-check` and `examples/creator-prompt-dna-adapter.html` before saving any generated media. If the target is motion/video direction, use `bun creator:motion-storyboard-check` and `examples/creator-motion-storyboard.html` before any renderer or contact sheet. If the target is a social post image, use `bun creator:social-card-check` and `examples/creator-social-card.html` before platform upload. If the target is a printable process zine, use `bun creator:pdf-zine-check` and `examples/creator-pdf-zine.html` before adding booklet tooling, print imposition, or private workshop notes. If the target is a p5.js creative-coding sketch, use `bun creator:p5-sketch-check` and `examples/creator-p5-sketch.html` before opening a p5 runtime or saving rendered media. If the target is a Remotion sequence/composition, use `bun creator:remotion-scene-check` and `examples/creator-remotion-scene.html` before installing renderer dependencies or exporting video. If the target is a Manim explainer scene, use `bun creator:manim-scene-check` and `examples/creator-manim-scene.html` before installing Manim dependencies or exporting MP4. If the target is a TouchDesigner/twozero live-network handoff, use `bun creator:touchdesigner-tox-check` and `examples/creator-touchdesigner-tox.html` before opening ports, connecting to TD, capturing screenshots, or exporting `.tox/.toe`. If the target is a browser-native demo, use `bun creator:browser-demo-check` and `examples/creator-browser-demo.html` before adding a frontend framework, backend, analytics, hosting config, screenshots, or public deploy. Keep the core minimal and put frontier tools at the adapter edge.

### If the user asks for Darwin-style self-evolution

Use the creator evolution path:

```bash
bun creator:playwright-health-check
bun creator:evolution-check
bun creator:mutation-check
bun creator:capsule-check
bun creator:docs-surface-parity
bun creator:remotion-scene-check
bun creator:manim-scene-check
bun creator:touchdesigner-tox-check
bun creator:browser-demo-check
bun creator:pdf-zine-check
bun docs:links
bun security:scan
bun hackathon:score
```

This means mutation, evaluation, selection, retention, and regression. Use the candidate ledger when comparing mutations. Do not reduce it to a dashboard. A dashboard is valid only when it controls the next creative mutation.

### If the user asks for a creator skill package

Use the repo-local package route:

```bash
bun creator:skill-package-check
bun docs:links
bun security:scan
```

The package artifact is [`skill-packages/creator-workflow/SKILL.md`](../skill-packages/creator-workflow/SKILL.md). It may be inspected or copied into a local skill loader for review, but it is not a public release and must not be synced to live agents without a separate reviewed release issue.

### If the user asks to “make the repo better”

Use the hackathon SDD loop:

```bash
bun docs:links
bun security:scan
bun hackathon:score
```

Then fix the highest-scoring gap. Do not start a broad rewrite.

## Next Workflow Slots

These are intentionally unshipped until they have commands and public boundaries:

|| Slot | Required before shipping |
|---|----|
| Browser demo external deploy / Vercel surface | deploy command, public URL, screenshot QA, rollback path; start from the shipped local browser demo route first |
| External skill publish/release | review-approved registry target, live install smoke, versioning, rollback, and public release note |
| Visual contact-sheet QA | shipped as `bun creator:contact-sheet-check`; writes ignored `.artifacts/creator-motion-contact-sheet.html` |

**Fixed-Canvas Browser QA Enforcement (browser-qa Darwin mutation)**

Default browser automation viewports often hide right-side or bottom controls on 1684×1191 or 1200×630 canvases, leading to false-positive "working" interaction reports. 

Mutation selected: Add explicit exact-viewport contract to all fixed-canvas routes.

- Always enforce `setViewportSize({ width: 1684, height: 1191 })` (or matching social canvas) in browser smoke.
- Verify: `innerWidth === canvasWidth`, no horizontal overflow, every `data-step` button receives click and updates `data-active-step` + `aria-pressed`.
- Capture: console errors, network (must be 0 external), CDP metrics, screenshot path.
- This prevents the mobile-crop and offscreen-control pitfalls noted in browser-qa skill.

Update all creator/*-check.ts and measure commands to include this when browser tools are used. Phenotype survives in updated WORKFLOW_INDEX and browser-demo HTML meta/viewport handling.

This advances week-3 fitness-evaluator mutation without growing core.

## 中文摘要

这里是 agent 的路线图：先判断要做 creator capsule、自进化 Darwin loop、document、fixed-canvas、p5 motion、video、外部 skill 棘轮，还是 repo hardening；每条路都必须有入口文件、包层、命令、QA 和公开边界。Darwin loop 指 mutation/evaluation/selection/retention/regression，不是 dashboard。没有这些，就不要假装 workflow 已经完成。
